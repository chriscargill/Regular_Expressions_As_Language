# Regular Expression(s) As Language - REAL
___

<br>

## Why:  
Regular expressions are difficult to learn and on top of that are different depending on the programming language you are using. People work best with words, let the computer handle the symbols. By creating an interface of words we abstract away the symbols.  
This is meant to be used both ways, going from a regex to a REAL and going from a REAL to a regex. Putting a complicated regex through the toREAL function should make the complicated regex much easier to quickly understand.

## Working on:  
There are still many things left to do to make this useful.
* Add in the dictionaries keys and values for all regex special characters
* Handle special characters in special circumstances; Ex: ^ can be not or the '^' character. Handle both situations.
* Create REAL words that make sense and are succinct
